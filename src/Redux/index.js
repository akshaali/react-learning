    1. It's a third party middleware library,                  1. Default middleware in redux
    redux-saga which means we have to integrate 
    it into our project

    2. Boilerplate work                                        2. We need no boilerplate work

    3. We use generator function.                              3. Promises to perform asyn task  

    4. Here actions clean js function                          4. Here we have to put the async function into
                                                                  the actioncreater itself

    6. Easy to test, as we have async task in                  6. A difficult to test the async function.
